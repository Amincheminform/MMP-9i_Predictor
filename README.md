**KidneyTox v1.0** is an easy-to-use predictive tool for evaluating the **nephrotoxicity** (kidney toxicity) of small molecules.

It is a <img src="https://streamlit.io/images/brand/streamlit-mark-color.svg" alt="Streamlit Logo" width="50"/>-based [Web Application](https://kidneytoxv1.streamlit.app/) that predicts the **kidney toxicity** of a small molecule and also visualizes the molecule with the contribution of the features in the prediction.

---
This tool is a part of the article "*KidneyTox_v1: A Machine Learning-based Tool for Predicting Nephrotoxicity of Molecule*" (Manuscript under preparation).

---
The **KidneyTox v1.0** web application can be used by following [This Link](https://kidneytoxv1.streamlit.app/).

Either sketch the molecule or enter a SMILES string to predict its **nephrotoxicity** (kidney toxicity)!
